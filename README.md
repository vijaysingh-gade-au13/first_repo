STEP 2 :  Cloned repository   : I clone the repository by typing git command --> git clone https://github.com/vijaysingh-gade-au13/first_repo.git first_repo,
                               as initially repository is empty same is reflected to local machine after cloning the remote repository.
STEP 3 :  Added README.md file : I mounted to first_repo and created README.md file by using touch command in terminal
                               then did git status to check unstaged file,furthur i typed git add . to add README.md to staged state,
                              
STEP 4 :  pushed it to GITHUB  : Then performed commit by command git commit -m "README.md added",
                               then push the file to remote by command  git push.
                               
STEP 5 : Cloned the same repo as sec_repo : git clone https://github.com/vijaysingh-gade-au13/first_repo.git sec_repo ---->this will create sec_repo in local machine.
